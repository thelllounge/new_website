<h1>Welcome to my workshop.</h1>
<p>This website will serve as two things.</p>
<h2>First, a collection of Writing Tools</h2>
<p>I have always loved to write. Because of this I have spent a lot of time doing it. There are a lot of tools I wished I had along the way. Sometimes my brain gets stuck, so I made a tool to force me out of that. Roll the dice and see what I <strong>must</strong> do in my story. Can't think of a title? Let the computer do it. None of the stories I'm currently working on are appealing? Let's think of a new prompt idea to write.</p>
<p>I have always had a bit of trouble with some of the sprint timers I've come across. A lot are based in Pomodoro, which is fine. It's a great tool. I wanted to be able to adjust the times though, and in the past many timers I saw didn't have that feature. They only worked with the Pomodoro style times.</p>
<p>Basically, I saw a space for tools I wanted to use either because I thought they would be helpful or because I thought they would be fun and interesting. (Like the title creator, I highly doubt it will accurately name your novel.)</p>
<p>I hope that you're able to find some joy out of these tools and maybe they'll help you to be more productive as well.</p>
<h2>Second, a coding portfolio</h2>
<p>During the beginning of the COVID pandemic I really questioned whether or not I still wanted to be a teacher. There were already a lot of problems in education and the pandemic just made everything a hundred times worse. I started to learn to code because of this.</p>
<p>I grew to love the ability to make my own tools and figuring out the problems that were in front of me. Each new puzzle stretched my brain in a way that teaching didn't and brought back a love I had forgotten I had for creating things. I also quickly remembered how customized I had made my MySpace in the past. Maybe I had always loved this and just forgot.</p>
<p>While I still haven't found exactly what it is that I <strong>love</strong> the most about coding, I haven't found anything that I don't like yet. I'll continue to keep exploring and trying new things until I find what it is that I love, or until someone pays me to love something.ðŸ˜‰ </p>
<p>Many of the projects that I come up with on my own are based in language learning or gaming. I am a language teacher who was planning on getting a PhD studying the use of games in the language classroom, so that makes sense to me. (If you ever want to talk about the pedagogical uses of games, both analog and digital please email me!) One day maybe I'll find a way to make a living combining the two professionally. Until now, we'll keep playing around.</p>
